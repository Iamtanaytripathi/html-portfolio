<h1> Devansh's movie recommendations </h1>
<h2> My favourite three movies</h2>
<hr />
<hr />
<h3>1. Interstellar </h3>
<p>Thought provoking and intriguing, keeping you on the edge of the seat constantly. </p>
<hr />
<h3>2. 3 Idiots </h3>
<p>Makes you laugh your ass off for 150 minutes while simulatneously teaching you important life lessons on the
    importance of individuality, passion and the outdated education system of our country </p>
<hr />
<h3>3. Shawshank Redemption </h3>
<p> Teaches us the importance of hope with excellent writing and great pacing </p>
