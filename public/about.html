<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Devansh Tripathi. I hail from a small town in the Indian state of Uttar Praadesh called Allahabad.Growing
  up,I was always the inquistive kid who had an insatiable thirst for knowledge of any kind. I have an avid interest in
  wide range of topics from economics,geopolitics,geography and history being few. As a kid,I would constantly daydream
  about complex worlds and would love to tinker with the concepts of love,creativity,success, and trauma. </p>

<p>Web development provides me the outlest to fully express my creative side.It requires the perfect blend of problem
  solving skills and a vivid imagination and with the ever increase rise of businesess investing heavily building and
  marketing their own websites after covid 19,it has become more relavant than ever</p>

<p>This is a rudimentary website highlighting my nascent journey in Web Development so far.It includes the various
  projects I have built including a movie reanking page and a birthday invite using basic knowledge of HTML. Hopefully,
  more convuluted and intricate websites will be included in the future.</p>
